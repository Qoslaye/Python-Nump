Numpy Overview 
----------------

Numpy : is powerful python library for numerical and scientific computing ,
it provides support for array (especially multi diamansial ) , mathemitical function ,
random number generation , and linear al gebra operation 

Why Numpy ? 
-Efficiancy : operation faster than standard python lists to optimized low level implementation 
-Memory Usage : Numpy uses less memory than python lists 
-broadcasting : allows efficent mathmetical operation between arrays of different shapes 
-integration : Numpy integrates seamlessly with many libraries in the python ecosystem
